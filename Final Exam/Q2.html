                  <h4 class="card-title">History of Kaiseki course menu</h4>
                  <p class="card-text">The kanji characters used to write "kaiseki" (懐石) literally mean "bosom-pocket stone". These kanji are thought to have been incorporated by Sen no Rikyū (1522–1591), to indicate the frugal meal served in the austere style of chanoyu (Japanese tea ceremony). The idea came from the practice where Zen monks would ward off hunger by putting warm stones into the front folds of their robes, near their stomachs.
                    Before these kanji started to be used, the kanji for writing the word were simply ones indicating that the cuisine was for a get-together (会席料理). Both sets of kanji remain in use today to write the word; the authoritative Japanese dictionary 'Kōjien' describes kaiseki (literally, "cuisine for a get-together") as a banquet meal where the main beverage is sake (Japanese rice wine), and the "bosom-stone" cuisine as the simple meal served in chanoyu. To distinguish between the two in speech and if necessary in writing, the chanoyu meal may be referred to as "tea" kaiseki, or cha-kaiseki.[7][8]
                    Modern kaiseki draws on a number of traditional Japanese haute cuisines, notably the following four traditions: imperial court cuisine (有職料理, yūsoku ryōri), from the 9th century in the Heian period; Buddhist cuisine of temples (精進料理, shōjin ryōri), from the 12th century in the Kamakura period; samurai cuisine of warrior households (本膳料理, honzen ryōri), from the 14th century in the Muromachi period; and tea ceremony cuisine (茶懐石, cha kaiseki), from the 15th century in the Higashiyama period of the Muromachi period. All of these individual cuisines were formalized and developed over time,
                    and continue in some form to the present day, but have also been incorporated into kaiseki cuisine. Different chefs weight these differently – court and samurai cuisine are more ornate, while temple and tea ceremony cuisine are more restrained.</p>

                        Originally, kaiseki comprised a bowl of miso soup and three side dishes; this is now instead the standard form of Japanese-style cuisine generally, referred to as a セット (setto, "set"). Kaiseki has since evolved to include an appetizer, sashimi, a simmered dish, a grilled dish and a steamed course, in addition to other dishes at the discretion of the chef.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Sakizuke (先附): an appetizer similar to the French amuse-bouche.</li>
                            <li>Hassun (八寸): the second course, which sets the seasonal theme. Typically one kind of sushi and several smaller side dishes.</li>
                            <li>Mukōzuke (向付): a sliced dish of seasonal sashimi.</li>
                            <li>Takiawase (煮合): vegetables served with meat, fish or tofu; the ingredients are simmered separately.</li>
                            <li>Futamono (蓋物): a "lidded dish"; typically a soup.</li>
                            <li>Yakimono (焼物): (1) flame-grilled food (esp. fish); (2) earthenware, pottery, china.</li>
                            <li>Su-zakana (酢肴): a small dish used to cleanse the palate, such as vegetables in vinegar; vinegared appetizer.</li>
                            <li>Hiyashi-bachi (冷し鉢): served only in summer; chilled, lightly cooked vegetables.</li>
                            <li>Naka-choko (中猪口): another palate-cleanser; may be a light, acidic soup.</li>
                            <li>Shiizakana (強肴): a substantial dish, such as a hot pot.</li>
                            <li>Gohan (御飯): a rice dish made with seasonal ingredients.</li>
                            <li>Kō no mono (香の物): seasonal pickled vegetables.</li>
                            <li>Tome-wan (止椀): a miso-based or vegetable soup served with rice.</li>
                            <li>Mizumono (水物): a seasonal dessert; may be fruit, confection, ice cream, or cake.</li>
